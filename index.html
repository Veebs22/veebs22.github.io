    <h3>My solo indie dev project: Queen of The Hill</h3>
    <p>
      Equal parts Rogue-Like, RTS, and Tower Defense, <strong>Queen of The Hill</strong> is an ant-themed Strategy/Adventure game I've been developing since 2024.  
      Designed to showcase my skillset as a developer, every detail was made by me — including the game engine.  
      The soundtrack, animations, story, art, sound effects, scripting, behavioral algorithms — everything.  
      The game is programmed in Java. No generative AI was used for any part of it.  
      Aside from the Processing library for rendering, every facet of this game was made by me and me alone.  
      The goal was to experience the entire lifecycle of a game, from start to finish, from scratch.  
      <br>
        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2946810/Queen_Of_The_Hill/" target ="_blank" Style = "padding: 5px; margin: 5px; border-radius: 8px; color: white; background-color: #23471D;">
          > The demo is available on Steam for free.
        </a>
      <br>
      Getting the Steam API to work without a game engine has been challenging, so currently, it only runs on Windows.  
      I apologize for any inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Throughout development, I:</strong></p>

    <p>- Wrote over 20,000 lines of Java code.</p>
    
    <p>- Created all the artwork in Photoshop, including 8 full-screen digital paintings and all sprite assets.</p>
    
    <p>- Designed and iterated on game mechanics, organizing playtests to refine a fun and engaging gameplay loop.</p>
    
    <p>- Animated particle effects, walk cycles, enemies, and UI elements.</p>
    
    <p>- Programmed a life-like simulation of an ant colony, leveraging emergent behaviors.</p>
    
    <p>- Developed performant algorithms for everything from collision detection to physics simulations and line-of-sight checks.</p>
    
    <p>- Composed 10 original music tracks, ranging from moody ambience to epic boss themes.</p>
    
    <p>- Recorded and sampled dozens of sound effects, while developing the audio playback system.</p>
    
    <p>- Documented the entire development process using GitHub.</p>
    
    <p>- Managed the project timeline, taking it from concept to a feature-complete playtest in 9 months, incorporating tester feedback throughout.</p>
    
    <p><strong>- Successfully made Queen of The Hill fun to play—arguably the hardest part.</strong></p>
