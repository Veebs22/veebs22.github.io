    <h3>My solo indie dev project: Queen of The Hill</h3>
    <p>
      Equal parts Rogue-Like, RTS, and Tower Defense, <strong>Queen of The Hill</strong> is an ant-themed Strategy/Adventure game I've been developing since 2024.  
      Designed to showcase my skillset as a developer, every detail was made by me — including the game engine.  
      The soundtrack, animations, story, art, sound effects, scripting, behavioral algorithms — everything.  
      The game is programmed in Java. No generative AI was used for any part of it.  
      Aside from the Processing library for rendering, every facet of this game was made by me and me alone.  
      The goal was to experience the entire lifecycle of a game, from start to finish, from scratch.  
      <br>
      <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2946810/Queen_Of_The_Hill/" target ="_blank" Style = "padding: 5px; margin: 5px; border-radius: 8px; color: white; background-color: #23471D;">>The demo is available on Steam for free.</a>
      <br>
      Getting the Steam API to work without a game engine has been challenging, so currently, it only runs on Windows.  
      I apologize for any inconvenience.
